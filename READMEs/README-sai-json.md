# .sai.json format

Projects can inform Sai of what build and test variations they want to run
on push using a `.sai.json` file in the top level dir of the project.

The git push hook isolated this file from the pushed tree and passes it to
the sai-server along with the rest of the push notification information in
a signed JSON structure.

## Simple .sai.json file

```
{
	"schema": "sai-1",

	# comments are OK
	#
	"platforms": {
		"linux-ubuntu-xenial-amd64": {
			"build": "mkdir build destdir;cd build;export CCACHE_DISABLE=1;cmake .. ${cmake};make -j;make -j DESTDIR=../destdir install && ctest -j4 --output-on-failure"
		}
		# you can continue to list platforms here
	},

	"configurations": {
		"plain": {
			"cmake":	"",
		}
	}
}
```

The effect of the above is a single build using a `linux-ubuntu-xenial-amd64`
platform builder with the arguments

```
	mkdir build destdir;
	cd build;
	export CCACHE_DISABLE=1;
	cmake ..;
	make -j;
	make -j DESTDIR=../destdir install &&
	ctest -j4 --output-on-failure
```

### Platforms section and default

In the top level `"platforms"` section you describe the different build
platforms you want to build and test on... the specified platforms must have
builders that have connected themselves to the sai-server.

If you don't give a `"default": false` entry in the platform definition, the
platform is assumed to apply to all the configurations listed afterwards.  If
you do set `"default": false` on a platform, it's taken to mean you will list
configurations you want it to apply to manually and that platform is not
automatically used otherwise.

### Configuration section

#### cmake

The configuration section lists build variations, the `"cmake"` entry allows
you to give additional cmake options like `-DSOMEFEATURE=1` that together define
the build variation.  These are applied additionally to the platform-specific
cmake options where the `${cmake}` token appears.

#### platforms

You can also give a `"platforms"` entry in each configuration specifiying which
platforms should build this configuration in a comma-separated list.  If you
don't give a `"platforms"` entry on a configuration, all default platforms will
be applied.  You can also list additional, non-default platform names you
want to apply, like

```
		"platforms":	"windows-10, linkit-cross, linux-debian-buster-arm32"
```

those will be applied on top of the defaults.  Other options are to disable
given default platforms:

```
		"platforms":	"not linux-ubuntu-xenial-amd64"
```

or to disable all default platforms and just use the specified ones:

```
		"platforms":	"none, windows-10"
```

#### artifacts

You can also give a comma-separated list of build artifacts, these are
arbitrary binary files which will be uploaded to sai-server and made available
for download over https.
